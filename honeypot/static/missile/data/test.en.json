Reportedly, South Korea did not detect the launch suggesting the missile exploded at a low altitude (before it could be picked up on South Korean radar). North Korea has also not released photographs of the test making it extremely difficult for 3rd party observers to confirm the location and the type of missile used in the launch. The test location was later located by finding the burn scars left by the test. The burn scars suggest that the October 15 test exploded on launch and destroyed the TEL transporting it (North Korea has since been much more careful with its remaining TELs). The type of missile tested at this test and the test 5 days later remains controversial. STRATCOM stated that it was a presumed Musudan. Later testimony by the DNI suggests that the US intelligence community has arrived at a similar consensus. It's possible though that the October tests were of any number of missile systems. The PK-2, tested successfully only a few kilometers away seems a plausible suspect. It could also have been an early test of the HS-12 , or perhaps some version of the KN-08. Considering the lack of hard evidence and the apparent consensus of the intelligence community, the October tests are entered as Musudans. However, they remain subject to revision should new information emerge."

This test marked another first for North Korea in 2017. It was the first successful test of the Scud-C MaRV, a missile with a maneuverable terminal stage. A maneuverable terminal stage is significant because such a system could potentially frustrate missile defense systems like THAAD. This missile was first sighted at the April 15, 2017 parade. This missile was initially believed to have been tested 3 times in April and failed repeatedly. Information has since surfaced that these were actually tests of the Hwasong-12.

Initial analysis suggests if launched on a trajectory to maximize its range then it could cover approximately 10,000 km. Such a missile brings most of the continental United States within range. The test was highly anticipated as well. There were multiple reports from US intelligence agencies that said North Korea was preparing for a missile launch sometime during the last week of July. However, most of those reports cited activity at Kusong, around where the first ICBM test was carried out. This test occurred over 100 km away from that location. Some have speculated that this test was North Korea's attempt to demonstrate that it could \"fake out\" US intelligence and carry out a launch without the US knowing where it would come from. Subsequent reports from South Korea and the US stated that the respective intelligence agencies were aware of and tracking the activity and were not fooled. The launch location itself appears to be a missile base or TEL maintenance facility close to the Chinese border."

This was revised in a later press release to state that only the 2nd missile suffered a failure, the 1st and 3rd did not.

It appears to be an attempt to update North Korea's oldest missile system. North Korea likely has lots of these missiles in storage, equipping them with maneuverable re-entry vehicles is a cheap and quick way to update an old system."

			"description": "This was the 3rd time North Korea launched a missile over the Japanese home islands. The first was in 1998 and the second was in 2009 (North Korea attempted a launch over Japan in 2006 but the rocket failed before overflying Japan). Initial reports suggested that North Korea launched 3 missiles, this was later determined to be inaccurate and that North Korea had only launched a single missile. The exact type of missile launched is unclear however we have can narrow it down. Based on the range alone it would have to be either the Hwasong-12 or the Hwasong-14 because those are the only known missiles in North Korea's arsenal capable of travelling that distance. The consensus is that this was a launch of the HS-12. The estimated maximum range of this missile is 4500 km making the 2700 km distance travelled puzzling. The reduced range was likely either the result of some failure with the missile or North Korea purposely testing the missile at a reduced range (both of which are not without precedence). This is unclear. Early reports out of Japan reported that the missile broke apart into multiple pieces suggesting a failure. In addition, the missile travelled only 2700 km, significantly shorter than its estimated range. North Korea later reported the test as a success and released photographs of the test and Kim Jong Un observing it. Maps placed in front of Kim suggest the missile may have been intended to travel farther than it did. A subsequent test on September 14 followed a similar trajectory except this time the missile travelled about 1000 km farther."

This time the missile travelled about 3700 km, which is about the distance it would have to travel to hit Guam. The missile travelled an a similar trajectory as the August 28 test which suggests this flight path could become a regular testing corridor over Japan."

The missile itself is noticeably larger than the Hwasong-14 and estimates for its range suggest it is capable of delivering a payload 13,000 km putting the entire United States within range. The test took place in a field next to the factory which it was rolled out of in images released by North Korea following the test."
